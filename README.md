C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that was developed in the early 1980s. It is an extension of the C programming language, adding features such as classes and objects to support object-oriented programming. It is widely used in various applications, including system software, video games, and desktop applications, due to its performance and versatility. The language is known for its fast execution, low-level access to system resources, and ability to manage complex data structures and algorithms.

In this repository, you will find a collection of my projects, experiments, problem solving, and studies in C++. Feel free to browse through the repository and leave a comment if you have any questions or feedback. Also, if you found it helpful (especially for the ITESM fellas), leave a star :)!

Happy coding!
